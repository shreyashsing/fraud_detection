## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shreyashsing/fraud_detection.git
   cd fraud_detection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   
   # On Windows
   env\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd fraud_detection_project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üíª Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Run the main script**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Explore data with Jupyter notebooks**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb
   ```

### Training Models

```python
from src.model_training import train_model
from src.data_preprocessing import preprocess_data

# Load and preprocess data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data('data/raw/transactions.csv')

# Train model
model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
```

### Making Predictions

```python
from src.evaluate import predict_fraud

# Predict on new data
predictions = predict_fraud(model, new_transaction_data)
```

## üìä Data

The system works with transaction datasets containing features such as:

- Transaction amount
- Merchant information
- User behavior patterns
- Temporal features
- Geographic data

**Note**: Due to privacy and size constraints, actual datasets are not included in the repository. Please ensure your data follows the expected format described in the preprocessing module.

## ü§ñ Models

The system implements several machine learning algorithms:

- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for robust classification
- **Gradient Boosting**: Advanced boosting technique for high accuracy
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning for complex pattern recognition
- **Isolation Forest**: Anomaly detection for outlier identification
- **SVM**: Support Vector Machines for classification

## üìà Results

The models are evaluated using various metrics:

- **Precision**: Minimizing false positives
- **Recall**: Capturing actual fraud cases
- **F1-Score**: Balanced performance measure
- **AUC-ROC**: Overall model performance
- **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed classification results
